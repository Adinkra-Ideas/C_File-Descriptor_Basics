# get_next_line
Get_Next_Line is a project where we were required to code 
a program that reads the text content of a file using a 
dynamic buffer and the file descriptor of a given file. 

* Allowed functions are Malloc(), Free() and Read(). 
* The program must read using a buffer on each call (using 
  any possible buffer value given to it).  
* The program must return a new line from the file regardless 
  on each call. 
* No memory leaks must be present upon completion.
